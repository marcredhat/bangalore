Advanced Traffic-Shadowing Patterns for Microservices with Istio Service Mesh
http://bit.ly/2SsVzRK

Istio blocks all outbound (outside of the cluster) traffic unless 
you specifically and explicitly create rules to allow traffic out. 

From a security standpoint, this is crucial. 

You can use Istio in both zero-trust networking architectures as well as 
traditional perimeter-based security
