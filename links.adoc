Tekton Pipeline with Sysdig Secure image scans on OpenShift 4.2+
https://lnkd.in/g84DmdM
Credits: I just added a Sysdig Secure image scan step to existing Tekton Pipeline examples
To do: use Tekton conditionals to make decisions based on scan results etc

Sysdig Inspect using podman

Advanced Traffic-Shadowing Patterns for Microservices with Istio Service Mesh
http://bit.ly/2SsVzRK

Istio blocks all outbound (outside of the cluster) traffic unless 
you specifically and explicitly create rules to allow traffic out. 

From a security standpoint, this is crucial. 

You can use Istio in both zero-trust networking architectures as well as 
traditional perimeter-based security


In the past, developers have often tried to use frameworks (EJBs, CORBA, RMI, etc.) 
to make network calls appear like local method invocations. 

This gave developers a false peace of mind. 
Without ensuring the application actively guarded against network failures, 
he entire system was susceptible to cascading failures.


Circuit breaking at the connection-pool level and at the load-balancing host level
Example: 
VirtualService splittingtraffic between v1 and v2
DestinationRule with max pending requests


Outlier detection / pool ejection
